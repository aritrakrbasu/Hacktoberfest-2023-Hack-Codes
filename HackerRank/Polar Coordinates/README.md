polar quardinates are an alternative way of representing Cartesian coordinates or Complex Numbers.

A complex number z
z=x+yj
is completely determined by its real part  and imaginary part y .
Here, j is the imaginary unit.
A polar coordinate (r,q)

is completely determined by modulus r and phase angle q .

If we convert complex number z to its polar coordinate, we find:
r: Distance from z to origin, i.e.√(x^2+y^2) 
q: Counter clockwise angle measured from the positive x-axis to the line segment that joins z to the origin.

Python's cmath module provides access to the mathematical functions for complex numbers.
cmath.phase

This tool returns the phase of complex number z (also known as the argument of z ).

>>> phase(complex(-1.0, 0.0))
3.1415926535897931

This tool returns the modulus (absolute value) of complex number z .

>>> abs(complex(-1.0, 0.0))
1.0
Task
You are given a complex z . Your task is to convert it to polar coordinates.

Input Format

A single line containing the complex number z. Note: complex() function can be used in python to convert the input as a complex number.

Constraints

Given number is a valid complex number
Output Format

Output two lines:
The first line should contain the value of r.
The second line should contain the value of q.
