Given a matrix as 2D array. Find the reverse spiral traversal of the matrix. 

Example 1:

Input: R = 3, C = 3
  a = {{9, 8, 7},
       {6, 5, 4},
       {3, 2, 1}}
Output: 5 6 3 2 1 4 7 8 9
Explanation: Spiral form of the matrix
in reverse order starts from the centre 
and goes outward.


Example 2:

Input: R = 4, C = 4 
  a = {{1, 2, 3, 4},
       {5, 6, 7, 8},
       {9, 10, 11, 12}, 
       {13, 14, 15, 16}}
Output: 10 11 7 6 5 9 13 14 15 16 12 8 4 3 2 1
Explanation: 


Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function reverseSpiral() which takes R, C and a as input parameters and returns the matrix in reverse spiral form.

Expected Time Complexity: O(R*C)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(R*C)

Constraints:
1 <= R,C <=100
1 <= a[R][C] <=100
