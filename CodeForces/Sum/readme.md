memory limit per test : 256 megabytes
input : standard input
output : standard output

You are given three integers a, b, and c. Determine if one of them is the sum of the other two.


### Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤9261) — the number of test cases.

The description of each test case consists of three integers a, b, c (0≤a,b,c≤20).

### Output

For each test case, output "YES" if one of the numbers is the sum of the other two, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).
