## Question 
Chef has A units of solid and B units of liquid. He combines them to create a mixture. What kind of mixture does Chef produce: a solution, a solid, or a liquid?

A mixture is called a:

1) A solution if A>0 and B>0,

2) A solid if B=0, or

3) A liquid if A=0.

## Input Format
The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B on a single line.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a single line the type of mixture Chef produces, whether it is a Solution, Solid, or Liquid. The output is case sensitive.

3 0
## Sample Output 1 
Solution
Liquid
Solid
## Explanation
Test case 1: Chef adds both solid and liquid to the mixture, hence the mixture is a solution.

Test case 2: Chef does not add solid to the mixture, hence the mixture is liquid.

Test case 3: Chef does not add liquid to the mixture, hence the mixture is solid.
