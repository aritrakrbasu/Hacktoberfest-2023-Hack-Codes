## Question
You are given two positive integers a and b. You also have a number x, which is initially set to 0. At first, you can add a to x any number of times. After that, you can divide x by b any number of times as long as x is divisible by b.

Print YES if you can make x
equal to 1, otherwise print NO.


## Input


    First line of input will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
    
    Each test case contains a single line, two positive integers a,b

## Output

    For each test case, output on one line YES if it is possible to make x
    , or NO if it is not possible to do so.

    Output is case insensitive, which means that "yes", "Yes", "YEs", "no", "nO" - all such strings will be acceptable
